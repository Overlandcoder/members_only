# Members Only

This is for the Members Only project from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com.

The goal here is to build an "exclusive clubhouse" where members can write anonymous posts. Only members can see who the author of a post is. Non-members (those who are not logged in) can only see the post and will be left wondering who the author is. This will be accomplished by using Devise as an authentication system.
